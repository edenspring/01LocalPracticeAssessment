/***********************************************************************
You are compiling a price checker for a grocery store. The grocery 
prices are as follows:

butter: $1, eggs: $2, milk: $3, bread: $4, cheese: $5

First, create a function called costOfGroceries(groceries) which takes a 
single array of grocery items and returns the total cost.

Then, write a function mostExpensiveGroceries(groceriesList) that takes 
in a 2-dimensional array of grocery items and returns the index of the 
sub-array with the highest cost.

This problem is worth 7 points. It is possible to get partial points on 
this problem.
