/***********************************************************************
Build a function called stringChanger() that takes in two arguments: a 
word and an operation. Based on the operation, your function will return 
the word modified in some way. The operations are:

"capitalize": Capitalize the first letter in the word.

"uppercase": Capitalize every letter in the word.

"double": Return the word twice in a row.

"reverse": Return the string with the letters in reverse order.

If the operation is invalid, return the word, unchanged.

This problem is worth 5 points. It is possible to get partial points on 
this problem.
